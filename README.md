Word Master is a fun, daily five-letter word puzzle inspired by Wordle. Players get 6 attempts to guess the secret word. After each guess, the tiles change color to give clues:

Green means the letter is correct and in the right position.

Yellow means the letter is in the word but in a different spot.

Gray means the letter is not in the word.
